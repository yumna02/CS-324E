<This project is a unique red pattern inspired by optical illusions featuring a dark to light red gradient. The code in this project includes three geometric primitives, three stroke weights, and thirteen different colors. The three geometric primitives include rect(), ellipse(), and point() â€“ all of which are used to create the pattern using the thirteen different colors. The thirteen different colors were coded with hexadecimal numbers as I had past experience with hexadecimal colors so it was the most comfortable format for me to code the colors in. There are three very minor stroke weights used to create some semblance of an optical illusion placed in the middle three diagonals. An important aspect to this program is the for-loops as there are 144 rect() used to create the pattern. Without the for-loops, there would be approximately 12 times as much code written in Processing. I wrote the entire program myself referencing back to the slides by Kevin Song from my CS 324E: Graphics/Visualization class. Additionally, I referenced a Processing.org reference page to learn how to implement strokeWeight() (reference page: https://processing.org/reference/strokeWeight_.html). There are no unresolved issues with my program at this time. >
