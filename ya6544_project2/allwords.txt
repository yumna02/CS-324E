the
picture
of
dorian
gray
author
oscar
wilde
chapter
i
the
studio
was
filled
with
the
rich
odour
of
roses
and
when
the
light
summer
wind
stirred
amidst
the
trees
of
the
garden
there
came
through
the
open
door
the
heavy
scent
of
the
lilac
or
the
more
delicate
perfume
of
the
pinkflowering
thorn
from
the
corner
of
the
divan
of
persian
saddlebags
on
which
he
was
lying
smoking
as
was
his
custom
innumerable
cigarettes
lord
henry
wotton
could
just
catch
the
gleam
of
the
honeysweet
and
honeycoloured
blossoms
of
a
laburnum
whose
tremulous
branches
seemed
hardly
able
to
bear
the
burden
of
a
beauty
so
flamelike
as
theirs
and
now
and
then
the
fantastic
shadows
of
birds
in
flight
flitted
across
the
long
tussoresilk
curtains
that
were
stretched
in
front
of
the
huge
window
producing
a
kind
of
momentary
japanese
effect
and
making
him
think
of
those
pallid
jadefaced
painters
of
tokyo
who
through
the
medium
of
an
art
that
is
necessarily
immobile
seek
to
convey
the
sense
of
swiftness
and
motion
the
sullen
murmur
of
the
bees
shouldering
their
way
through
the
long
unmown
grass
or
circling
with
monotonous
insistence
round
the
dusty
gilt
horns
of
the
straggling
woodbine
seemed
to
make
the
stillness
more
oppressive
the
dim
roar
of
london
was
like
the
bourdon
note
of
a
distant
organ
in
the
centre
of
the
room
clamped
to
an
upright
easel
stood
the
fulllength
portrait
of
a
young
man
of
extraordinary
personal
beauty
and
in
front
of
it
some
little
distance
away
was
sitting
the
artist
himself
basil
hallward
whose
sudden
disappearance
some
years
ago
caused
at
the
time
such
public
excitement
and
gave
rise
to
so
many
strange
conjectures
as
the
painter
looked
at
the
gracious
and
comely
form
he
had
so
skilfully
mirrored
in
his
art
a
smile
of
pleasure
passed
across
his
face
and
seemed
about
to
linger
there
but
he
suddenly
started
up
and
closing
his
eyes
placed
his
fingers
upon
the
lids
as
though
he
sought
to
imprison
within
his
brain
some
curious
dream
from
which
he
feared
he
might
awake
it
is
your
best
work
basil
the
best
thing
you
have
ever
done
said
lord
henry
languidly
you
must
certainly
send
it
next
year
to
the
grosvenor
the
academy
is
too
large
and
too
vulgar
whenever
i
have
gone
there
there
have
been
either
so
many
people
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
the
pictures
which
was
dreadful
or
so
many
pictures
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
the
people
which
was
worse
the
grosvenor
is
really
the
only
place
i
dont
think
i
shall
send
it
anywhere
he
answered
tossing
his
head
back
in
that
odd
way
that
used
to
make
his
friends
laugh
at
him
at
oxford
no
i
wont
send
it
anywhere
lord
henry
elevated
his
eyebrows
and
looked
at
him
in
amazement
through
the
thin
blue
wreaths
of
smoke
that
curled
up
in
such
fanciful
whorls
from
his
heavy
opiumtainted
cigarette
not
send
it
anywhere
my
dear
fellow
why
have
you
any
reason
what
odd
chaps
you
painters
are
you
do
anything
in
the
world
to
gain
a
reputation
as
soon
as
you
have
one
you
seem
to
want
to
throw
it
away
it
is
silly
of
you
for
there
is
only
one
thing
in
the
world
worse
than
being
talked
about
and
that
is
not
being
talked
about
a
portrait
like
this
would
set
you
far
above
all
the
young
men
in
england
and
make
the
old
men
quite
jealous
if
old
men
are
ever
capable
of
any
emotion
i
know
you
will
laugh
at
me
he
replied
but
i
really
cant
exhibit
it
i
have
put
too
much
of
myself
into
it
lord
henry
stretched
himself
out
on
the
divan
and
laughed
yes
i
knew
you
would
but
it
is
quite
true
all
the
same
too
much
of
yourself
in
it
upon
my
word
basil
i
didnt
know
you
were
so
vain
and
i
really
cant
see
any
resemblance
between
you
with
your
rugged
strong
face
and
your
coalblack
hair
and
this
young
adonis
who
looks
as
if
he
was
made
out
of
ivory
and
roseleaves
why
my
dear
basil
he
is
a
narcissus
and
youwell
of
course
you
have
an
intellectual
expression
and
all
that
but
beauty
real
beauty
ends
where
an
intellectual
expression
begins
intellect
is
in
itself
a
mode
of
exaggeration
and
destroys
the
harmony
of
any
face
the
moment
one
sits
down
to
think
one
becomes
all
nose
or
all
forehead
or
something
horrid
look
at
the
successful
men
in
any
of
the
learned
professions
how
perfectly
hideous
they
are
except
of
course
in
the
church
but
then
in
the
church
they
dont
think
a
bishop
keeps
on
saying
at
the
age
of
eighty
what
he
was
told
to
say
when
he
was
a
boy
of
eighteen
and
as
a
natural
consequence
he
always
looks
absolutely
delightful
your
mysterious
young
friend
whose
name
you
have
never
told
me
but
whose
picture
really
fascinates
me
never
thinks
i
feel
quite
sure
of
that
he
is
some
brainless
beautiful
creature
who
should
be
always
here
in
winter
when
we
have
no
flowers
to
look
at
and
always
here
in
summer
when
we
want
something
to
chill
our
intelligence
dont
flatter
yourself
basil
you
are
not
in
the
least
like
him
you
dont
understand
me
harry
answered
the
artist
of
course
i
am
not
like
him
i
know
that
perfectly
well
indeed
i
should
be
sorry
to
look
like
him
you
shrug
your
shoulders
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
there
is
a
fatality
about
all
physical
and
intellectual
distinction
the
sort
of
fatality
that
seems
to
dog
through
history
the
faltering
steps
of
kings
it
is
better
not
to
be
different
from
ones
fellows
the
ugly
and
the
stupid
have
the
best
of
it
in
this
world
they
can
sit
at
their
ease
and
gape
at
the
play
if
they
know
nothing
of
victory
they
are
at
least
spared
the
knowledge
of
defeat
they
live
as
we
all
should
liveundisturbed
indifferent
and
without
disquiet
they
neither
bring
ruin
upon
others
nor
ever
receive
it
from
alien
hands
your
rank
and
wealth
harry
my
brains
such
as
they
aremy
art
whatever
it
may
be
worth
dorian
grays
good
lookswe
shall
all
suffer
for
what
the
gods
have
given
us
suffer
terribly
dorian
gray
is
that
his
name
asked
lord
henry
walking
across
the
studio
towards
basil
hallward
yes
that
is
his
name
i
didnt
intend
to
tell
it
to
you
but
why
not
oh
i
cant
explain
when
i
like
people
immensely
i
never
tell
their
names
to
any
one
it
is
like
surrendering
a
part
of
them
i
have
grown
to
love
secrecy
it
seems
to
be
the
one
thing
that
can
make
modern
life
mysterious
or
marvellous
to
us
the
commonest
thing
is
delightful
if
one
only
hides
it
when
i
leave
town
now
i
never
tell
my
people
where
i
am
going
if
i
did
i
would
lose
all
my
pleasure
it
is
a
silly
habit
i
dare
say
but
somehow
it
seems
to
bring
a
great
deal
of
romance
into
ones
life
i
suppose
you
think
me
awfully
foolish
about
it
not
at
all
answered
lord
henry
not
at
all
my
dear
basil
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
am
married
and
the
one
charm
of
marriage
is
that
it
makes
a
life
of
deception
absolutely
necessary
for
both
parties
i
never
know
where
my
wife
is
and
my
wife
never
knows
what
i
am
doing
when
we
meetwe
do
meet
occasionally
when
we
dine
out
together
or
go
down
to
the
dukeswe
tell
each
other
the
most
absurd
stories
with
the
most
serious
faces
my
wife
is
very
good
at
itmuch
better
in
fact
than
i
am
she
never
gets
confused
over
her
dates
and
i
always
do
but
when
she
does
find
me
out
she
makes
no
row
at
all
i
sometimes
wish
she
would
but
she
merely
laughs
at
me
i
hate
the
way
you
talk
about
your
married
life
harry
said
basil
hallward
strolling
towards
the
door
that
led
into
the
garden
i
believe
that
you
are
really
a
very
good
husband
but
that
you
are
thoroughly
ashamed
of
your
own
virtues
you
are
an
extraordinary
fellow
you
never
say
a
moral
thing
and
you
never
do
a
wrong
thing
your
cynicism
is
simply
a
pose
being
natural
is
simply
a
pose
and
the
most
irritating
pose
i
know
cried
lord
henry
laughing
and
the
two
young
men
went
out
into
the
garden
together
and
ensconced
themselves
on
a
long
bamboo
seat
that
stood
in
the
shade
of
a
tall
laurel
bush
the
sunlight
slipped
over
the
polished
leaves
in
the
grass
white
daisies
were
tremulous
after
a
pause
lord
henry
pulled
out
his
watch
i
am
afraid
i
must
be
going
basil
he
murmured
and
before
i
go
i
insist
on
your
answering
a
question
i
put
to
you
some
time
ago
what
is
that
said
the
painter
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
you
know
quite
well
i
do
not
harry
well
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
i
want
you
to
explain
to
me
why
you
wont
exhibit
dorian
grays
picture
i
want
the
real
reason
i
told
you
the
real
reason
no
you
did
not
you
said
it
was
because
there
was
too
much
of
yourself
in
it
now
that
is
childish
harry
said
basil
hallward
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
every
portrait
that
is
painted
with
feeling
is
a
portrait
of
the
artist
not
of
the
sitter
the
sitter
is
merely
the
accident
the
occasion
it
is
not
he
who
is
revealed
by
the
painter
it
is
rather
the
painter
who
on
the
coloured
canvas
reveals
himself
the
reason
i
will
not
exhibit
this
picture
is
that
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
shown
in
it
the
secret
of
my
own
soul
lord
henry
laughed
and
what
is
that
he
asked
i
will
tell
you
said
hallward
but
an
expression
of
perplexity
came
over
his
face
i
am
all
expectation
basil
continued
his
companion
glancing
at
him
oh
there
is
really
very
little
to
tell
harry
answered
the
painter
and
i
am
afraid
you
will
hardly
understand
it
perhaps
you
will
hardly
believe
it
lord
henry
smiled
and
leaning
down
plucked
a
pinkpetalled
daisy
from
the
grass
and
examined
it
i
am
quite
sure
i
shall
understand
it
he
replied
gazing
intently
at
the
little
golden
whitefeathered
disk
and
as
for
believing
things
i
can
believe
anything
provided
that
it
is
quite
incredible
the
wind
shook
some
blossoms
from
the
trees
and
the
heavy
lilacblooms
with
their
clustering
stars
moved
to
and
fro
in
the
languid
air
a
grasshopper
began
to
chirrup
by
the
wall
and
like
a
blue
thread
a
long
thin
dragonfly
floated
past
on
its
brown
gauze
wings
lord
henry
felt
as
if
he
could
hear
basil
hallwards
heart
beating
and
wondered
what
was
coming
the
story
is
simply
this
said
the
painter
after
some
time
two
months
ago
i
went
to
a
crush
at
lady
brandons
you
know
we
poor
artists
have
to
show
ourselves
in
society
from
time
to
time
just
to
remind
the
public
that
we
are
not
savages
with
an
evening
coat
and
a
white
tie
as
you
told
me
once
anybody
even
a
stockbroker
can
gain
a
reputation
for
being
civilized
well
after
i
had
been
in
the
room
about
ten
minutes
talking
to
huge
overdressed
dowagers
and
tedious
academicians
i
suddenly
became
conscious
that
some
one
was
looking
at
me
i
turned
halfway
round
and
saw
dorian
gray
for
the
first
time
when
our
eyes
met
i
felt
that
i
was
growing
pale
a
curious
sensation
of
terror
came
over
me
i
knew
that
i
had
come
face
to
face
with
some
one
whose
mere
personality
was
so
fascinating
that
if
i
allowed
it
to
do
so
it
would
absorb
my
whole
nature
my
whole
soul
my
very
art
itself
i
did
not
want
any
external
influence
in
my
life
you
know
yourself
harry
how
independent
i
am
by
nature
i
have
always
been
my
own
master
had
at
least
always
been
so
till
i
met
dorian
gray
thenbut
i
dont
know
how
to
explain
it
to
you
something
seemed
to
tell
me
that
i
was
on
the
verge
of
a
terrible
crisis
in
my
life
i
had
a
strange
feeling
that
fate
had
in
store
for
me
exquisite
joys
and
exquisite
sorrows
i
grew
afraid
and
turned
to
quit
the
room
it
was
not
conscience
that
made
me
do
so
it
was
a
sort
of
cowardice
i
take
no
credit
to
myself
for
trying
to
escape
conscience
and
cowardice
are
really
the
same
things
basil
conscience
is
the
tradename
of
the
firm
that
is
all
i
dont
believe
that
harry
and
i
dont
believe
you
do
either
however
whatever
was
my
motiveand
it
may
have
been
pride
for
i
used
to
be
very
proudi
certainly
struggled
to
the
door
there
of
course
i
stumbled
against
lady
brandon
you
are
not
going
to
run
away
so
soon
mr
hallward
she
screamed
out
you
know
her
curiously
shrill
voice
yes
she
is
a
peacock
in
everything
but
beauty
said
lord
henry
pulling
the
daisy
to
bits
with
his
long
nervous
fingers
i
could
not
get
rid
of
her
she
brought
me
up
to
royalties
and
people
with
stars
and
garters
and
elderly
ladies
with
gigantic
tiaras
and
parrot
noses
she
spoke
of
me
as
her
dearest
friend
i
had
only
met
her
once
before
but
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
lionize
me
i
believe
some
picture
of
mine
had
made
a
great
success
at
the
time
at
least
had
been
chattered
about
in
the
penny
newspapers
which
is
the
nineteenthcentury
standard
of
immortality
suddenly
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
the
young
man
whose
personality
had
so
strangely
stirred
me
we
were
quite
close
almost
touching
our
eyes
met
again
it
was
reckless
of
me
but
i
asked
lady
brandon
to
introduce
me
to
him
perhaps
it
was
not
so
reckless
after
all
it
was
simply
inevitable
we
would
have
spoken
to
each
other
without
any
introduction
i
am
sure
of
that
dorian
told
me
so
afterwards
he
too
felt
that
we
were
destined
to
know
each
other
and
how
did
lady
brandon
describe
this
wonderful
young
man
asked
his
companion
i
know
she
goes
in
for
giving
a
rapid
prcis
of
all
her
guests
i
remember
her
bringing
me
up
to
a
truculent
and
redfaced
old
gentleman
covered
all
over
with
orders
and
ribbons
and
hissing
into
my
ear
in
a
tragic
whisper
which
must
have
been
perfectly
audible
to
everybody
in
the
room
the
most
astounding
details
i
simply
fled
i
like
to
find
out
people
for
myself
but
lady
brandon
treats
her
guests
exactly
as
an
auctioneer
treats
his
goods
she
either
explains
them
entirely
away
or
tells
one
everything
about
them
except
what
one
wants
to
know
poor
lady
brandon
you
are
hard
on
her
harry
said
hallward
listlessly
my
dear
fellow
she
tried
to
found
a
salon
and
only
succeeded
in
opening
a
restaurant
how
could
i
admire
her
but
tell
me
what
did
she
say
about
mr
dorian
gray
oh
something
like
charming
boypoor
dear
mother
and
i
absolutely
inseparable
quite
forget
what
he
doesafraid
hedoesnt
do
anythingoh
yes
plays
the
pianoor
is
it
the
violin
dear
mr
gray
neither
of
us
could
help
laughing
and
we
became
friends
at
once
laughter
is
not
at
all
a
bad
beginning
for
a
friendship
and
it
is
far
the
best
ending
for
one
said
the
young
lord
plucking
another
daisy
hallward
shook
his
head
you
dont
understand
what
friendship
is
harry
he
murmuredor
what
enmity
is
for
that
matter
you
like
every
one
that
is
to
say
you
are
indifferent
to
every
one
how
horribly
unjust
of
you
cried
lord
henry
tilting
his
hat
back
and
looking
up
at
the
little
clouds
that
like
ravelled
skeins
of
glossy
white
silk
were
drifting
across
the
hollowed
turquoise
of
the
summer
sky
yes
horribly
unjust
of
you
i
make
a
great
difference
between
people
i
choose
my
friends
for
their
good
looks
my
acquaintances
for
their
good
characters
and
my
enemies
for
their
good
intellects
a
man
cannot
be
too
careful
in
the
choice
of
his
enemies
i
have
not
got
one
who
is
a
fool
they
are
all
men
of
some
intellectual
power
and
consequently
they
all
appreciate
me
is
that
very
vain
of
me
i
think
it
is
rather
vain
i
should
think
it
was
harry
but
according
to
your
category
i
must
be
merely
an
acquaintance
my
dear
old
basil
you
are
much
more
than
an
acquaintance
and
much
less
than
a
friend
a
sort
of
brother
i
suppose
oh
brothers
i
dont
care
for
brothers
my
elder
brother
wont
die
and
my
younger
brothers
seem
never
to
do
anything
else
harry
exclaimed
hallward
frowning
my
dear
fellow
i
am
not
quite
serious
but
i
cant
help
detesting
my
relations
i
suppose
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
none
of
us
can
stand
other
people
having
the
same
faults
as
ourselves
i
quite
sympathize
with
the
rage
of
the
english
democracy
against
what
they
call
the
vices
of
the
upper
orders
the
masses
feel
that
drunkenness
stupidity
and
immorality
should
be
their
own
special
property
and
that
if
any
one
of
us
makes
an
ass
of
himself
he
is
poaching
on
their
preserves
when
poor
southwark
got
into
the
divorce
court
their
indignation
was
quite
magnificent
and
yet
i
dont
suppose
that
ten
per
cent
of
the
proletariat
live
correctly
i
dont
agree
with
a
single
word
that
you
have
said
and
what
is
more
harry
i
feel
sure
you
dont
either
lord
henry
stroked
his
pointed
brown
beard
and
tapped
the
toe
of
his
patentleather
boot
with
a
tasselled
ebony
cane
how
english
you
are
basil
that
is
the
second
time
you
have
made
that
observation
if
one
puts
forward
an
idea
to
a
true
englishmanalways
a
rash
thing
to
dohe
never
dreams
of
considering
whether
the
idea
is
right
or
wrong
the
only
thing
he
considers
of
any
importance
is
whether
one
believes
it
oneself
now
the
value
of
an
idea
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
sincerity
of
the
man
who
expresses
it
indeed
the
probabilities
are
that
the
more
insincere
the
man
is
the
more
purely
intellectual
will
the
idea
be
as
in
that
case
it
will
not
be
coloured
by
either
his
wants
his
desires
or
his
prejudices
however
i
dont
propose
to
discuss
politics
sociology
or
metaphysics
with
you
i
like
persons
better
than
principles
and
i
like
persons
with
no
principles
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
tell
me
more
about
mr
dorian
gray
how
often
do
you
see
him
every
day
i
couldnt
be
happy
if
i
didnt
see
him
every
day
he
is
absolutely
necessary
to
me
how
extraordinary
i
thought
you
would
never
care
for
anything
but
your
art
he
is
all
my
art
to
me
now
said
the
painter
gravely
i
sometimes
think
harry
that
there
are
only
two
eras
of
any
importance
in
the
worlds
history
the
first
is
the
appearance
of
a
new
medium
for
art
and
the
second
is
the
appearance
of
a
new
personality
for
art
also
what
the
invention
of
oilpainting
was
to
the
venetians
the
face
of
antinous
was
to
late
greek
sculpture
and
the
face
of
dorian
gray
will
some
day
be
to
me
it
is
not
merely
that
i
paint
from
him
draw
from
him
sketch
from
him
of
course
i
have
done
all
that
but
he
is
much
more
to
me
than
a
model
or
a
sitter
i
wont
tell
you
that
i
am
dissatisfied
with
what
i
have
done
of
him
or
that
his
beauty
is
such
that
art
cannot
express
it
there
is
nothing
that
art
cannot
express
and
i
know
that
the
work
i
have
done
since
i
met
dorian
gray
is
good
work
is
the
best
work
of
my
life
but
in
some
curious
wayi
wonder
will
you
understand
mehis
personality
has
suggested
to
me
an
entirely
new
manner
in
art
an
entirely
new
mode
of
style
i
see
things
differently
i
think
of
them
differently
i
can
now
recreate
life
in
a
way
that
was
hidden
from
me
before
a
dream
of
form
in
days
of
thoughtwho
is
it
who
says
that
i
forget
but
it
is
what
dorian
gray
has
been
to
me
the
merely
visible
presence
of
this
ladfor
he
seems
to
me
little
more
than
a
lad
though
he
is
really
over
twentyhis
merely
visible
presenceah
i
wonder
can
you
realize
all
that
that
means
unconsciously
he
defines
for
me
the
lines
of
a
fresh
school
a
school
that
is
to
have
in
it
all
the
passion
of
the
romantic
spirit
all
the
perfection
of
the
spirit
that
is
greek
the
harmony
of
soul
and
bodyhow
much
that
is
we
in
our
madness
have
separated
the
two
and
have
invented
a
realism
that
is
vulgar
an
ideality
that
is
void
harry
if
you
only
knew
what
dorian
gray
is
to
me
you
remember
that
landscape
of
mine
for
which
agnew
offered
me
such
a
huge
price
but
which
i
would
not
part
with
it
is
one
of
the
best
things
i
have
ever
done
and
why
is
it
so
because
while
i
was
painting
it
dorian
gray
sat
beside
me
some
subtle
influence
passed
from
him
to
me
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
saw
in
the
plain
woodland
the
wonder
i
had
always
looked
for
and
always
missed
basil
this
is
extraordinary
i
must
see
dorian
gray
hallward
got
up
from
the
seat
and
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
after
some
time
he
came
back
harry
he
said
dorian
gray
is
to
me
simply
a
motive
in
art
you
might
see
nothing
in
him
i
see
everything
in
him
he
is
never
more
present
in
my
work
than
when
no
image
of
him
is
there
he
is
a
suggestion
as
i
have
said
of
a
new
manner
i
find
him
in
the
curves
of
certain
lines
in
the
loveliness
and
subtleties
of
certain
colours
that
is
all
then
why
wont
you
exhibit
his
portrait
asked
lord
henry
because
without
intending
it
i
have
put
into
it
some
expression
of
all
this
curious
artistic
idolatry
of
which
of
course
i
have
never
cared
to
speak
to
him
he
knows
nothing
about
it
he
shall
never
know
anything
about
it
but
the
world
might
guess
it
and
i
will
not
bare
my
soul
to
their
shallow
prying
eyes
my
heart
shall
never
be
put
under
their
microscope
there
is
too
much
of
myself
in
the
thing
harrytoo
much
of
myself
poets
are
not
so
scrupulous
as
you
are
they
know
how
useful
passion
is
for
publication
nowadays
a
broken
heart
will
run
to
many
editions
i
hate
them
for
it
cried
hallward
an
artist
should
create
beautiful
things
but
should
put
nothing
of
his
own
life
into
them
we
live
in
an
age
when
men
treat
art
as
if
it
were
meant
to
be
a
form
of
autobiography
we
have
lost
the
abstract
sense
of
beauty
some
day
i
will
show
the
world
what
it
is
and
for
that
reason
the
world
shall
never
see
my
portrait
of
dorian
gray
i
think
you
are
wrong
basil
but
i
wont
argue
with
you
it
is
only
the
intellectually
lost
who
ever
argue
tell
me
is
dorian
gray
very
fond
of
you
the
painter
considered
for
a
few
moments
he
likes
me
he
answered
after
a
pause
i
know
he
likes
me
of
course
i
flatter
him
dreadfully
i
find
a
strange
pleasure
in
saying
things
to
him
that
i
know
i
shall
be
sorry
for
having
said
as
a
rule
he
is
charming
to
me
and
we
sit
in
the
studio
and
talk
of
a
thousand
things
now
and
then
however
he
is
horribly
thoughtless
and
seems
to
take
a
real
delight
in
giving
me
pain
then
i
feel
harry
that
i
have
given
away
my
whole
soul
to
some
one
who
treats
it
as
if
it
were
a
flower
to
put
in
his
coat
a
bit
of
decoration
to
charm
his
vanity
an
ornament
for
a
summers
day
days
in
summer
basil
are
apt
to
linger
murmured
lord
henry
perhaps
you
will
tire
sooner
than
he
will
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
think
of
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
genius
lasts
longer
than
beauty
that
accounts
for
the
fact
that
we
all
take
such
pains
to
overeducate
ourselves
in
the
wild
struggle
for
existence
we
want
to
have
something
that
endures
and
so
we
fill
our
minds
with
rubbish
and
facts
in
the
silly
hope
of
keeping
our
place
the
thoroughly
wellinformed
manthat
is
the
modern
ideal
and
the
mind
of
the
thoroughly
wellinformed
man
is
a
dreadful
thing
it
is
like
a
bricbrac
shop
all
monsters
and
dust
with
everything
priced
above
its
proper
value
i
think
you
will
tire
first
all
the
same
some
day
you
will
look
at
your
friend
and
he
will
seem
to
you
to
be
a
little
out
of
drawing
or
you
wont
like
his
tone
of
colour
or
something
you
will
bitterly
reproach
him
in
your
own
heart
and
seriously
think
that
he
has
behaved
very
badly
to
you
the
next
time
he
calls
you
will
be
perfectly
cold
and
indifferent
it
will
be
a
great
pity
for
it
will
alter
you
what
you
have
told
me
is
quite
a
romance
a
romance
of
art
one
might
call
it
and
the
worst
of
having
a
romance
of
any
kind
is
that
it
leaves
one
so
unromantic
harry
dont
talk
like
that
as
long
as
i
live
the
personality
of
dorian
gray
will
dominate
me
you
cant
feel
what
i
feel
you
change
too
often
ah
my
dear
basil
that
is
exactly
why
i
can
feel
it
those
who
are
faithful
know
only
the
trivial
side
of
love
it
is
the
faithless
who
know
loves
tragedies
and
lord
henry
struck
a
light
on
a
dainty
silver
case
and
began
to
smoke
a
cigarette
with
a
selfconscious
and
satisfied
air
as
if
he
had
summed
up
the
world
in
a
phrase
there
was
a
rustle
of
chirruping
sparrows
in
the
green
lacquer
leaves
of
the
ivy
and
the
blue
cloudshadows
chased
themselves
across
the
grass
like
swallows
how
pleasant
it
was
in
the
garden
and
how
delightful
other
peoples
emotions
weremuch
more
delightful
than
their
ideas
it
seemed
to
him
ones
own
soul
and
the
passions
of
ones
friendsthose
were
the
fascinating
things
in
life
he
pictured
to
himself
with
silent
amusement
the
tedious
luncheon
that
he
had
missed
by
staying
so
long
with
basil
hallward
had
he
gone
to
his
aunts
he
would
have
been
sure
to
have
met
lord
goodbody
there
and
the
whole
conversation
would
have
been
about
the
feeding
of
the
poor
and
the
necessity
for
model
lodginghouses
each
class
would
have
preached
the
importance
of
those
virtues
for
whose
exercise
there
was
no
necessity
in
their
own
lives
the
rich
would
have
spoken
on
the
value
of
thrift
and
the
idle
grown
eloquent
over
the
dignity
of
labour
it
was
charming
to
have
escaped
all
that
as
he
thought
of
his
aunt
an
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
he
turned
to
hallward
and
said
my
dear
fellow
i
have
just
remembered
remembered
what
harry
where
i
heard
the
name
of
dorian
gray
where
was
it
asked
hallward
with
a
slight
frown
dont
look
so
angry
basil
it
was
at
my
aunt
lady
agathas
she
told
me
she
had
discovered
a
wonderful
young
man
who
was
going
to
help
her
in
the
east
end
and
that
his
name
was
dorian
gray
i
am
bound
to
state
that
she
never
told
me
he
was
goodlooking
women
have
no
appreciation
of
good
looks
at
least
good
women
have
not
she
said
that
he
was
very
earnest
and
had
a
beautiful
nature
i
at
once
pictured
to
myself
a
creature
with
spectacles
and
lank
hair
horribly
freckled
and
tramping
about
on
huge
feet
i
wish
i
had
known
it
was
your
friend
i
am
very
glad
you
didnt
harry
why
i
dont
want
you
to
meet
him
you
dont
want
me
to
meet
him
no
mr
dorian
gray
is
in
the
studio
sir
said
the
butler
coming
into
the
garden
you
must
introduce
me
now
cried
lord
henry
laughing
the
painter
turned
to
his
servant
who
stood
blinking
in
the
sunlight
ask
mr
gray
to
wait
parker
i
shall
be
in
in
a
few
moments
the
man
bowed
and
went
up
the
walk
then
he
looked
at
lord
henry
dorian
gray
is
my
dearest
friend
he
said
he
has
a
simple
and
a
beautiful
nature
your
aunt
was
quite
right
in
what
she
said
of
him
dont
spoil
him
dont
try
to
influence
him
your
influence
would
be
bad
the
world
is
wide
and
has
many
marvellous
people
in
it
dont
take
away
from
me
the
one
person
who
gives
to
my
art
whatever
charm
it
possesses
my
life
as
an
artist
depends
on
him
mind
harry
i
trust
you
he
spoke
very
slowly
and
the
words
seemed
wrung
out
of
him
almost
against
his
will
what
nonsense
you
talk
said
lord
henry
smiling
and
taking
hallward
by
the
arm
he
almost
led
him
into
the
house
